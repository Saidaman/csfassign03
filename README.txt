Please note:
Most of the work was done together, with very little emphasis on individual work. But for the purpose of this README, 
below are *estimations* of who mostly worked on what functionality. Whatever funcionality/functions are not mentioned 
below were evenly split among the team members.

Saidaman Earla Contributions:
Prepared GitHub repo and mostly worked on the C main method and asm_hexmain.S

Shayan Hossain Contributions:
Mostly worked on implementing C functions, asm_hexfuncs.S and did finishing touches (stylistic consistency, etc.)
